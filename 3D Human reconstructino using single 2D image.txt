<A. Algorithms for recovering human shape and pose>
1. Algorithm End-to-end Recovery of Human Shape and Pose (June, 2019)
- End-to-end recovery can determine the locatino of key joints even if the person in the photo is turned away.
input data: RGB single image
Encoder -> 3D regression module(반복적으로 3D model 의 loss를 minimize) -> discriminator가 real human인지 아닌지 판단.

Comparation of HMR with other methods by criteria of 3D reconstruction loss, time needed for -->1번은 best results.

--> 옷의 shape은 recover하지 못함.
2. SiCloPe: Silhouette-Based Clothed People(August, 2019)는 shape와 clothe를 둘 다 reconstruct함.
--> model texture를 recreates.

3. PIFu: PIxel-Aligned Implicit Function for High-Resolution Clothed Human Digitization (November, 2019).
input: single or multiple images.
장점: complicated figures(crumbled clothes, highe heels, hair-style)에 대해서도 weel reconstruct.

<B. The parameterized algorithms of human recovery>
1. Skinned multi-person linear model (SMPL) - 2015
trained on some thousnads of 3D models of human bodies(different forms/ figures).
